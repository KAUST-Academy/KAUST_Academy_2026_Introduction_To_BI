        "### 1. NCBI BLAST – Local Alignment & Similarity Search\n",
        "**BLAST** (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) finds regions of high similarity between biological sequences (DNA, RNA, proteins). Unlike global alignment, it focuses on **local** matches — ideal for detecting conserved motifs, domains, or partial similarities in large databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Main Uses**:\n",
        "- Finding homologous sequences across species  \n",
        "- Gene/protein identification  \n",
        "- Functional annotation of unknown sequences  \n",
        "- Locating conserved domains/motifs  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Access**: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi  \n",
        "Quick intro: https://microbenotes.com/blast-bioinformatics/\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Clustal Omega – Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)\n",
        "**Clustal Omega** is a fast, accurate tool for aligning multiple DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.  \n",
        "It uses a **progressive alignment** strategy + **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** for high-quality results, even with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Strengths**:\n",
        "- Handles large numbers of sequences efficiently  \n",
        "- Produces high-quality alignments quickly  \n",
        "- Supports web interface and command-line use  \n",

        "### 3. Biopython – Parsing & Analyzing Alignments in Python\n",
        "**Biopython** is the go-to Python library for computational biology.  \n",
        "It excels at reading, parsing, and manipulating sequence alignments (Clustal, FASTA, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example: Parsing a Clustal Alignment with Biopython\n",
        "\n",
        "You can parse a Clustal alignment file using the following code:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from Bio import AlignIO\n",
        "\n",
        "# Read the Clustal alignment file\n",
        "alignment = AlignIO.read(\"alignment.clustal\", \"clustal\")\n",
        "print(alignment)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This code reads a Clustal alignment file and prints the alignment object, which contains the sequences and their corresponding alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example: Calculating Sequence Identity:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from Bio import AlignIO\n",
        "\n",
        "alignment = AlignIO.read(\"alignment.clustal\", \"clustal\")\n",
        "total_sequences = len(alignment)\n",
        "identical_pairs = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "for i in range(total_sequences):\n",
        "    for j in range(i + 1, total_sequences):\n",
        "        identical_pairs += sum(a == b for a, b in zip(alignment[i], alignment[j]))\n",
